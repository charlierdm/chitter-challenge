## Objective

```
As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

```
As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made
```
```

So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter
```

HARDER

```
As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter
```
```
As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter
```

ADVANCED
